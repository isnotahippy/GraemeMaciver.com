		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
		<p>I am a London based software engineer who graduated from the 
		<a href="http://strath.ac.uk">University of Strathclyde</a> with a 
		BSc in Computer Science. However, I prefer to talk about my 5+ years of 
		software engineering experience. This includes 3 years of freelancing, 1.66 <a href="#startups">failed start ups</a>, 
		&infin; <a href="#sides">side projects</a>, 3 months volunteering in <a href="#shelter">India</a>, almost 2 years volunteering with Engineers Without Borders UK, 1 night in the <a href="#icetoolkit">House of Commons</a> and 1 year working alongside 
		some of the world's leading marketing agencies with <a href="#cohaesus">Cohaesus</a>. 
		During this time I've learned a few tricks, became a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">ScrumMaster</a> 
		and built a bunch of cool things.

		<h3 id="cohaesus">Cohaesus Projects Ltd</h3>
		<h4>March 2012 - Present</h4>
		<p>I have been with Cohaesus since March 2012 building the technical side of digital campaigns for some of the worlds largest marketing agencies. Cohaesus remains platform agnostic which exposes our team to lots of technologies and environments. My role here extends beyond the software engineering. I am responsible for the day to day running of projects and our outsourced teams, a point of contact for our clients, regularly attending client meetings and act as lead developer. I work as a full stack engineer, getting involved in all areas of the applications life cycle.</p>

		<h4>2008 - 2012</h4>
		<p>During my time at university I got into freelancing and working with my own clients. My projects were mainly website builds for small businesses, and the odd tech support job. My projects may not have been ground breaking, but the experience of gaining and managing my own clients is one that I am definitely proud of. Freelancing was a lot of fun, and being able to say goodbye to my shelf stacking job made the difficulties worth it.</p>

		<h2 id="sides">Side Projects</h2>
		<p>Like every other software engineer in the world I am constantly working on some killer idea, most never see the light of day; though normally i do at least learn something from them. Below are a couple of recent ones.</p>

		<h3 id="buses">London buses in real time</h3>
		<p>I challenged myself to create a real time map of buses operating in London, similar to maps that have been created for the London Underground. Since beginning I've realised this is a slightly more ambitious challenge than creating a map of the London Underground. The London Underground can operate 527 trains during rush hour, across 270 stations, which is a lot I'd say. However, the London bus network consists of 7,500 red buses, 19,500 bus stops, along almost 700 routes. Even in the middle of the night there are at least 1000 buses on the road! That is a lot of data to project onto a map...</p>
		<p>This raises a lot of issues, from how to locate each bus and how to project it's location onto a bus route. Transport for London provide the required data, in various forms and degrees of usefulness. So far I've been able to locate buses, and map routes but not quite get the overlay of buses on routes correct. I will be soon open sourcing the data I've collated so far and current progress on Github. In the meantime do contact me if you want to know more - I could talk for a while.</p>

		<h3 id="spotitube">Spotify / Youtube mash up</h3>
		<p>Having a quick play around with the Spotify app API, Pusher, and Youtube I created an interesting little app that pushes your currently playing track information to a fronted which pulls a relevant video from Youtube (usually a music the music video for the track). This was created as a visual experiment, and is also on Github.</p>

		<h2 id="startups">Start ups</h2>
		<p>I love to solve problems, and the idea of taking a solution to a problem I'm passionate about and creating a business from it thrills me. The start up community in London was a large part of the reason I moved here, I wanted to surround myself with likeminded people and get involved. </p>

		<h3 id="bookpond">The Book Pond</h3>
		<p>Built around 2008, The Book Pond provides an online peer to peer marketplace bringing together students who are looking to buy and sell academic text books, without paying book shop fees. The website was marketed on university campuses in the UK, was a feature on Pocket Lint and BBC Click's Webscape. Unfortunately the website never fully took off, but it is still ticking over at www.theBookPond.com</p>

		<h3 id="simplypaste">Simply Paste <span>(0.66 startup)</span></h3>
		<p>Another online match maker, Simply Paste was to be the place to go for editors to easily obtain high quality handwritten copy, articles, and other journalistic artefacts. Built on a LAMP stack, with a heavy Javascript/partial loading front end the website was a lot of fun to build, however in the end the business was not meant to be.  </p>

		<h2 id="volunteering">Engineers Without Borders</h2>
		<p>Thanks to EWB-UK in 2011 I travelled to India to work with Shelter Associates for 3 months. Since then I have been volunteering as a placement manager, helping more recent volunteers with their own placements. This includes the continuation of the Shelter Associates placement and also a new placement this year which aims to construct a long range wireless mesh network in rural Nepal. Along with this I have been involved in a few IT projects with EWB. You can find out more about the placements programme below.</p>

		<h3 id="shelter">Shelter Associates</h3>
		<p>In 2011 I travelled to India, supported by EWB-UK to work with Shelter Associates in Pune. Shelter Associates are an NGO who work to improve the lives of slum dwellers in Maharastra. During my three months with Shelter I worked on their data system and Drupal based website. The project has progressed since my visit thanks to more recent volunteers, who have worked on improving the slum survey system, and expanding this to allow surveys to be completed on mobile devices which removes the manual process of entering data collected on paper. Shelter is a great example of how Information Technology can be used to make measurable difference in international development.</p>

		<h3 id="icetoolkit">ICE Toolkit</h3>
		<p>This is an engineers toolkit for international development which frames common challenges an engineer may face while working in the field, and potential solutions to those challenges. This helps the engineer to respond and also understand the approach required to deal with such challenges. The toolkit was originally planned as a set of printed cards, though it was decided that for a longer lifespan the toolkit would be better as set of content which lived in a CMS of some sort. The end result is a Drupal website containing all of the ~80 cards created by the Institute of Civil Engineers presidents apprentices in 2009-2010. The website was officially launched on the 22nd January 2013 in the House of Commons.</p>

		<p>EWB-UK recently held its first conference in London and I was asked to help out with a one page website for the conference. While squeezed for time and lacking a real designer's eye I stuck together a simple one pager with a fun D3.js powered interaction in it's header. </p>

		<p>Like every other software engineer in the world I am constantly working on some killer idea, most never see the light of day - though normally i do at least learn something from them. Below are a couple of recent ones.</p>

		<h3 id="buses">London buses in real time</h3>
		<p>I challenged myself to create a real time map of buses operating in London, similar to maps that have been created for the London Underground. Since beginning I've realised this is a slightly more ambitious challenge than creating a map of the London Underground. The London Underground can operate 527 trains during rush hour, across 270 stations, which is a lot I'd say. However, the London bus network consists of 7,500 red buses, 19,500 bus stops, along almost 700 routes. Even in the middle of the night there are at least 1000 buses on the road! That is a lot of data to project onto a mapâ€¦</p>
		<p>This raises a lot of issues, from how to locate each bus and how to project it's location onto a bus route. Transport for London provide the required data, in various forms and degrees of usefulness. So far I've been able to locate buses, and map routes but not quite get the overlay of buses on routes correct. I will be soon open sourcing the data i've collated so far and current progress on Github. In the meantime do contact me if you want to know more - I could talk for a while.</p>

		<h3 id="spotitube">Spotify / Youtube mash up</h3>
		<p>Having a quick play around with the Spotify app API, Pusher, and Youtube I created an interesting little app that pushes your currently playing track information to a fronted which pulls a relevant video from Youtube (usually a music the music video for the track). This was created as a visual experiment, and is also on Github.</p>
